# Travel Diary Platform Application

The Travel Diary Platform Application is a Node.js-based system designed to manage and store travel entries securely. It offers functionalities to create, read, update, and delete travel entries via a RESTful API.

## Introduction

The Travel Diary Platform Application allows users to create, manage, and store their travel experiences. Leveraging Node.js and Express.js for backend development, it provides a robust API for interacting with diary entries stored in a database.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations on diary entries
- Secure storage of travel entries
- Object-oriented programming principles applied for scalability and maintainability

## Folder Structure

The application follows a well-organized folder structure:

```
Travel_Diary_Platform/
│
├── config/
│   ├── db.js
│   └── middleware.js
│
├── controllers/
│   ├── authController.js
│   └── diaryController.js
│
├── models/
│   ├── User.js
│   └── DiaryEntry.js
│
├── routes/
│   ├── authRoutes.js
│   └── diaryRoutes.js
│
├── services/
│   ├── authService.js
│   └── diaryService.js
│
└── utils/
    ├── errorHandler.js
    └── validation.js
```

- **config**: Contains configuration files for database and middleware.
- **controllers**: Contains controller files for handling user authentication and diary entry operations.
- **models**: Defines the schemas for User and DiaryEntry models.
- **routes**: Defines routes for user authentication and diary entry operations.
- **services**: Contains service files for business logic separation.
- **utils**: Includes utility files for error handling and validation.

## Installation

To set up the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Travel_Diary_Platform.git`
2. Change directory: `cd Travel_Diary_Platform`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure database connection in `config/db.js`
5. Start the server: `node app.js`

## Usage

The server starts at http://localhost:3000 by default. Once the server is running, you can access the defined API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Login an existing user
- **GET /api/auth/profile**: Get user profile (requires authentication)

### Diary Entries

- **POST /api/diary**: Create a new diary entry (requires authentication)
- **GET /api/diary**: Get all diary entries (requires authentication)
- **GET /api/diary/:id**: Get a specific diary entry by ID (requires authentication)
- **PUT /api/diary/:id**: Update a diary entry by ID (requires authentication)
- **DELETE /api/diary/:id**: Delete a diary entry by ID (requires authentication)

## Authentication

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and used for subsequent authenticated requests.

## Testing

Comprehensive testing is performed to ensure the functionality and security of the API endpoints. Unit tests cover authentication, CRUD operations, and error handling.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- bcryptjs (for password hashing)
